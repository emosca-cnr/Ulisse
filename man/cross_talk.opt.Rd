\title{Function to caluclate cross-talk}
\usage{
cross_talk.opt(mat = NULL, w1 = NULL, w2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{the matrix on which calculate the cross-talk. It should be the subset of the adjacency matrix of
a gene network, with on the rows the genes of a gene set, and on the columns the genes of anoher one to}

\item{weight}{the vector of weights associated to the gene in `mat`. The weights shoud be named by the genes}
}
\value{
The function returns an array with:
\itemize{
\item ct: cross-talk value
\item ngenes_1, ngenes_2: number of gene in geneset 1 (rows) and geneset 2 (columns)
\item nlink: number of link between geneset 1 and 2
\item gene_1, gene_2: genes involved in the links between geneset 1 and 2
}
}
\description{
`cross_talk()` calculates the cross-talk score for a provided matrix and vector of weights
}
\details{
The function calculates the cross-talk values for a provided matrix and a list of vectors of weights (fist row, second column).
The weights should be named by gene names
}
